# Detect Gestures


#### This program uses the webcam to detect a human's hand motion gesture, and depending on it, does some actions.

To make it detect your gesture, you only need to click left mouse button, and release after finished your motion gesture.

Motion gestures are the same as the touchpad:

        1. Three fingers left - change to right screen or desktop.
        2. Three fingers up  - the same as Start + tab (see all opened apps). If before that you did three fingers down, it just opens up all the collaped apps
        3. Three fingers right - change to left screen or desktop.
        4. Three fingers down - collapse all the apps. If before that you did three fingers up and you are seeing all the opened apps, it just takes all to the normal view. (i. e. opens the app you were working on)
        
Attention:  The program works only in Windows OS;
